    "\n",
    "Python's multiprocessing module provides a way to create and manage multiple processes in a Python program.\n",
    "Each process has its own memory space and runs independently, allowing for parallel execution of tasks. \n",
    "This is especially beneficial when dealing with CPU-bound tasks, where the program spends a significant amount \n",
    "of time performing computations and doesn't have to wait for external resources like I/O operations.\n",

    "To use the multiprocessing module, you typically create a Process object for each task you want to run in parallel.\n",
    "You can also use constructs like Pool to manage a pool of worker processes. Additionally, the Queue class from \n",

    "1.Processes vs. Threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own memory space and resources.\n",
    "Processes are independent and separate from each other, running in their own memory and having their own copies of variables.\n",
    "They can run on different CPU cores simultaneously, achieving true parallelism. Processes are created using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process. \n",
    "Threads share the same memory space and resources as the parent process.\n",
    "They run concurrently within the same process and can communicate more easily through shared memory. \n",

    "\n",
    "-Multiprocessing: Processes communicate through mechanisms like Queue and Pipe. Since processes have separate memory spaces, \n",
    "communication requires serialization and deserialization, which can be slower but offers better isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multithreading: Threads can communicate more easily through shared memory, making synchronization and data sharing simpler.\n",

    "4.GIL Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL since each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "This makes multiprocessing suitable for CPU-bound tasks where the GIL would otherwise limit the performance gains of multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multithreading: Multithreading is subject to the GIL, which means that even though multiple threads are created, only one thread \n",
    "can execute Python bytecode at a time. This makes multithreading less effective for CPU-bound tasks that require significant computation.'''"
